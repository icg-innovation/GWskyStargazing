# GW-sky-Stargazing
Materials for putting together an immersive sonified VR video, illustrating GWOSC detections using STRAUSS. Looking towards _Pompey Stargazing 2024_

Can set up an environment via the `requirements.txt` function  and register as an ipython kernel to run the notebook

running `./setup_dev_githooks.sh`will set up pre-commit hook to clear notebooks and stop you commiting loads of output data 

running `./make_video.sh` will download materials from NASA for making graphics and combne videos after the notebook is run

## To-do

- Add an animation layer for merger positions...
- Decide on base 'speed' for GW wave event (long, low-frequency or short, high-frequency)
- create an ideal timebase that shortens the gaps between runs?
